# Blockchain Studies
For my CS 485 (Independent Readings in CS) class for the Spring 22 semester,
I am learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

My weekly work will consist of research such as reading whitepapers, learning
about projects, studying the underlying technology behind blockchains and
various projects, and experimenting with projects (either by using them or
developing with them).

Besides having acquired this knowledge, I hope to materialize it with writeups
of the work I have been doing, perhaps to the level that it may be useful for
others to teach themselves a concept.

Furthermore, I would like to deliver something concrete, either production
level code in open source projects, or creating a small/proof-of-concept
project of my own.

Check out my weekly updates in this repo.

## Project Ideas
Production Projects:
- Trin
- Livepeer

PoC Projects:
- TBD

Although I have yet to formulate any substantial ideas for a PoC project of
my own, here are some ideas I toyed around with in my brain:
- Building a custom blockchain client of my own. With the Cosmos SDK and
Polkadot's Substrate framework this becomes a lot easier. It would help me
learn a lot about the so-called "3rd generation blockchains" while also
teach me a bunch about what goes into building a blockchain client.
    - Building a university or club currency
- Building a P2P networking application with libp2p. Libp2p is a modular
library that contains different modules that go into building a networking
stack. Although not explicitly blockchain programming, it is closely related
as all blockchains are P2P.
- Contributing or building upon a Substrate or Cosmos based project.
    - Robonomics Network
    - Energy Web Token
